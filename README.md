# utterson
Utterson is a take on a managment wrapper for Jekyll and possibly Hyde. Both provide very capable command-line interfaces and as such Utterson is not design as a replacement or to fill a large gap. Instead it started as a method to manage a specific method of using Jekyll for a blog. Utterson implements many conventions that are not manditory with Jekyll and thus makes a trade-off of flexibility for management simplification.
