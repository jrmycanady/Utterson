# utterson
Utterson is a take on creating a managment wrapper for Jekyll and possibly Hyde. Both provide very capable command-line interfaces and as such Utterson is not design as a replacement or to fill a large void. Instead it started as a shortcut mechanism to add some basic functionality to a Jekyll or Hydate based blog.
